## 📂 Project Structure
- `README.md` → Instructions on setup and usage.
- `requirements.txt` → List of required Python dependencies.
- `ens_preprocessing.py` → Main script for downloading and preprocessing the data from SDGE/SDSC. 
- `weather_training.py` → Main script for *weather variables* (wind speed, air humidity, etc.) ML model training. 
- `midterm_energy.py` → Main script for *energy conductor* (type, structure, etc.) data processing, visualization, and ML model training.
- `nature_index.py` → Main script for *vegetation, geographical, and living* data processing, visualization, and ML model training.
- Jupyter Notebooks → For testing/development. Due to data security, no cummulative outputs are shown. 
- `website_viz` → Images for GitHub page. 

**Note:** The datasets are not publicly available, so they cannot be uploaded here. However, you can find their metadata below.

## 🔧 Installation & Environment Setup for Vegetation file (nature_index.py) and Energy file (midterm_energy.py)

To ensure a **consistent environment**, we recommend using **Conda** to manage dependencies.

#### **1️⃣ Install Conda**
If you haven't installed Conda, download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

#### **2️⃣ Create a Conda Virtual Environment**
Open a terminal and run: 
```
bash
conda create --name wildfire_analysis python=3.9 -y
conda activate wildfire_analysis
```

#### **3️⃣ Install Required Packages**
```
pip install numpy pandas networkx geopandas shapely folium seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

or

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **4️⃣ Run the Script**
```
python <filename.py>
```
