Open a terminal and run: ```bash

conda create --name wildfire_analysis python=3.9 -y

conda activate wildfire_analysis

### **3️⃣ Install Required Packages**
pip install numpy pandas networkx geopandas shapely folium seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn 

or

pip install -r requirements.txt

### **4️⃣ Run the Script**
