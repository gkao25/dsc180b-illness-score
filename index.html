        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Wildfires are a major environmental and safety issue in Southern California, and they are becoming more common and threatening due to climate change and drought. One of the most common source of ignition is faulty power lines, and utility companies like San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) have been making efforts to analyze the reasons. Through the power of data science, utility companies can analyze the risk of a wildfire happneing and prevent it by turning off the power grid, thus lowering the probability of a bush catching on fire because of nearby, high-voltage power lines. Such an event is called a power safety public shutoff (PSPS). SDG&E's current data analysis include weather reports (wind speed), vegetation in the geographical area, and the conductor span impact on serviced customers. Our project aims to further analyze possible reasons for a wildfire, and create a more data-informed system that decides when a emergency shutoff is indeed needed or when it might impact people more negatively than positively.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>We coded a few different types of machine learning models in Python, with the help of data science packages such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scipy. </p>
        <p>We have 4 models in total, which is 2 less of our proposed factors in ILLNESS because some of the factors are similar enough to be combined into one model. Each model uses a different machine learning algorithm that is best suited to their data type. For each model, a corresponding type of dataset is taken as input and learns the mathematical parameters according to the algorithm. The learned model predicts the wildfire risk using a test dataset and outputs a score, which we collect for the final composite ILLNESS model. </p>

        <h3>
            Predicted Wildfire Risk Using the Intermediate Models
        </h3>
        Below is an interactive heatmap that shows our predicted wildfire risk. A redder area indicates a higher risk. The areas are divided into districts of San Diego County, making it easier for users to find their location. When the mouse is hovered over an area, the tooltip shows the district name and wildfire risk breakdown: energy, nature, weather, and overall. The red-green color scale shows according to the overall score.

        <h3>
            Final Composite ILLNESS Model
        </h3>
        <p>We created a mathematical model to assess wildfire risk and impact of power shutoffs. It includes all the aforementioned factors: weather, nature, and infrastructure wildfire risk within an area, plus the impact on customers if power is shut off. Each varaible is weighted according to its importance, and produce a final score that indicates the PSPS risk.</p>
        <p>The overall composite score measures the magnitude of deviation from zero, with larger absolute values indicating stronger recommendations. A negative score suggests that the area should not undergo a PSPS, meaning power should be maintained to minimize impact. Conversely, a positive score indicates that the area should be PSPSed, prioritizing wildfire risk mitigation over potential disruptions.</p>

        <h3>
            Predicted Areas for PSPS Using Our ILLNESS Model
        </h3>
        Below is an interactive heatmap that shows PSPS risk, i.e. where a PSPS should occur or not. The difference between this visualization and the previous one is that the population risk (life/living factor) is considered as well, so we can assess the impact a PSPS will bring to a community. A redder area means a higher PSPS risk, therefore should not be shut off. As you can see, the red areas are mostly downtown, where the population is dense and that increases the life risk factor. If an area is green, that means the PSPS impact is low, or that risk of wildfire outweighs the risk on the community and a power shutoff is needed.

    <div class="explanation" id="discussion">
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>As we can see from the heatmaps, the east side of San Diego County has higher wildfire risk but lower PSPS risk. Geographically, the east side has more valleys that guide strong and dry Santa Ana wind into the area, which makes wildfires more likely. Those districts are also less populated so the impact of an PSPS is predicted to be low (as illustrated by the green color), and a PSPS can be safely issued without too much concerns from the neighbors. </p>
        <p>On the flip side, the west side of the county has a lower wildfire risk but higher PSPS risk. This is because most of the population live in or close to downtown San Diego, which is on the coast. Shutting off the energy of this area could lead to many problems, from general inconvenience to larger safety on the road or in public areas. There are special cases like Ramona, where the heatmap colors change from red to green. Even though these districts are populated and the life factor should be high, the risk of wildfire still outweighs the risk on the community, and a PSPS is strongly advised to mitigate damage on the houses and on people. </p>
        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
        <p>This project could be for internal use, implemented by SDG&E as a more data-informed decision maker for issuing a PSPS. The datasets can be expanded to include more and newer data, such as the meteorology data collected from SDG&E's weather stations every 10 minutes. We could also include data from different sources, such as public weather data, satelite images of vegetation, and public census for the life factor. </p>
        <p>Our project can also benefit the general public, as the ILLNESS model provides a single numerical value that is easy to interpret, even for those who may not understand the PSPS decision process entirely. Although our current geographical heatmaps are static, we could improve them by creating a live dashboard that updates the score periodically. It would again include the tooltip details with score breakdowns, as we want to provide transparency to people who consumes energy from SDG&E so they are aware of possible PSPS events and the reasons. </p>
