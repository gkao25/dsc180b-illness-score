        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Wildfires are a major environmental and safety issue in Southern California, and they are becoming
        more common and threatening due to climate change and drought. One of the most common reasons of ignited wildfire is 
        faulty power lines, and utility companies like San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) have been making efforts to 
        analyze the reasons. Through data anaylsis, utility companies can predict the risk of a wildfire happneing 
        and prevent it by turning off the power grid, and the event is called a power safety public shutoff (PSPS). 
        SDG&E's current data analysis include weather reports (wind speed), vegetation in the geographical area, and 
        the conduct span impact on serviced customers. Our project aims to further analyze possible reasons for a wildfire, 
        and create a more data-informed system that decides when a emergency shutoff is indeed needed or when it 
        might impact people more negatively than positively.

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        To create a multi-factor machine learning model designed to enhance the accuracy of PSPS decisions.<br>
        We call it the <b>ILLNESS Model</b>, which stands for <b>I</b>nsights on...

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>We coded a few different types of machine learning models in Python, with the help of data science packages such as  
        Pandas, NumPy, and Scipy. </p>
        <p>We have 4 models in total, which is 2 less of our proposed factors in ILLNESS because 
        some of the factors are similar enough to be combined into one model. Each model uses a different machine learning 
        algorithm that is best suited to their data type. For each model, a corresponding type of dataset is taken as input and
        learns the mathematical parameters according to the algorithm. The learned model predicts the wildfire risk 
        using a test dataset and outputs a score, which we collect for the final composite ILLNESS model. </p>

        The features here are the most critical for understanding what our model is looking at when considering wildfire and/or 
        PSPS risk.

            Predicted Wildfire Risk Using the Intermediate Models
        </h3>
        Below is an interactive heatmap that shows our predicted wildfire risk. A redder area indicates a higher risk. 
        The areas are divided into districts of San Diego County, making it easier for users to find their location. 
        When the mouse is hovered over an area, the tooltip shows the district name and wildfire risk breakdown: energy, nature, 
        weather, and overall. The red-green color scale shows according to the overall score.

        <h3>
            Final Composite ILLNESS Model
        </h3>
        <p>We created a mathematical model to assess wildfire risk and impact of power shutoffs. 
        It includes all the aforementioned factors: weather, nature, and infrastructure wildfire risk within an area, and the impact on customers if power is shut off. Each varaible is weighted according to its importance, and produce a final score 
        that indicates the PSPS risk. This number ranges from 1 to 100, which makes it easy to understand at a high level. Other mathematical constants are included to scale and adjust for interactions or overlaps between different wildfire risk factors.</p>

        <h3>
            Predicted Areas for PSPS Using Our ILLNESS Model
        </h3>
        Below is an interactive heatmap that shows PSPS risk, i.e. where a PSPS should occur or not. The difference between this 
        visualization and the previous one is that the population risk (life/living factor) is considered as well, so we can 
        assess the impact a PSPS will bring to a community. 
        A redder area means a higher PSPS risk, therefore should not be shut off. As you can see, the red areas are mostly 
        downtown, where the population is dense and that increases the life/living risk factor. If an area is 
        green, that means the risk of wildfire outweighs the risk on the community, and a power shutoff is needed.

    <div class="explanation" id="discussion">
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>As we can see from the heatmaps, the east side of San Diego County has higher wildfire risk but lower PSPS risk. Geographically, the east side has more valleys that guide strong and dry Santa Ana wind into the area, which makes wildfires more likely. Those districts are also less populated so the impact of an PSPS is predicted to be low (as illustrated by the green color), so a PSPS can be safely issued without concerns from the neighbors. </p>
        <p>On the flip side, the west (coastal) area of the county has a lower wildfire risk but higher PSPS risk. This is because most of the population live closer to the coast, which is downtown San Diego. Shutting off the energy of this area could lead to many problems, from general inconvenience to larger safety on the road or in public areas. There are special cases like Rancho Mission Viejo and Ramona, where the heatmap colors change from red to green. Even though these districts are populated and the life factor should be high, the risk of wildfire still outweighs the risk on the community, and a PSPS should definitely be issued to mitigate damage. </p>
        <p>This project could be for internal use, implemented by SDG&E. It can also be for public, as the ILLNESS model 
        provides a single numerical value that is easy to interpret. Our current geographical heatmaps are static, 
        and we could improve by making them a dashboard that updates the score live. We want to provide transparency to people who uses energy from SDG&E so they are aware of possible PSPS events and the reasons. </p>
