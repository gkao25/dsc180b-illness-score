    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Wildfire has always been a problem in Southern California, and they are becoming
    more common and threatening due to climate change and drought. One of the most common ignitor of wildfire is 
    falling power lines, and utility companies like San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) have been making efforts to 
    analyze the reasons. Some

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    To create a multi-factor machine learning model designed to enhance the accuracy of PSPS decisions.<br>
    We call it the <b>ILLNESS Model</b>, which stands for <b>I</b>nsight on...

<div class="explanation" id="methods">
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    We coded a few different types of machine learning models in Python, with the help of data science packages like 
    Pandas, NumPy, and Scipy.
